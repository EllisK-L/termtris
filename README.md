# termtris

This is a minimal implementation of Tetris which can be played from the convenience of your terminal.

The current control scheme is:

1. A: Left
2. D: Right
3. N: Rotate Piece counter clockwise
4. M: Rotate Piece clockwise
5. Q: Quit Termtris

Planned improvements:

- Change the character set to make pieces and board easier to see
- Add second control scheme which uses the arrow keys
- Add delayed auto shift on the side to side movement
- Add ability to push down to increase drop speed
- Add scores and levels with drop speed increases
